# ibiblio Radiostats 

## Summary 
 
ibiblio hosts online streams for radio stations. Our task is to develop a web app that will automate the retrieval of bandwidth and cost data. The web app should show monthly costs and grant permissions to manage/view the data based on user (ibiblio admin, station staff, SILS finance).

## Getting Started

<br>

### Prerequisites:

To setup virtualenv for development

```sh 
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
what other software needs to be installed before developing or running this software (e.g. Node.js)? Give specific commands to install the software, noting any assumptions about package management tools or operating system.

### Installing: 

how can a user get a working development environment? Give step-by-step instructions.

__Running locally:__ 

once everything is installed, how can a user start a local server?

__Warranty:__ 

when (in terms of date or commit) were these instructions last tested and verified to work, by whom, and on what operating system?



## Testing

How can the user run the test suite? Give specific commands.
Any other test-related commands to know about, e.g. a different command for unit tests vs. integration tests?
## Deployment

Where does the production system live? How would a new developer get access to it?

Are there any staging or pre-production environments that developers can use?

What are the various pieces that the fully deployed software uses? For example, with Heroku, what addons does the app use?
Is continuous integration or continuous deployment enabled? If so, where does it live?

## Technologies Used

List which technologies were chosen.
Mention where in the repository the ADRs live. (Add them to the repository if they’re not already there.)

## Contributing

Does a new developer need to get access to any systems (e.g. the GitHub repository, Trello) before he or she is able to contribute?
Are there any style, testing, or process conventions that a new developer should know about?
Include a link to your project web site for more background information.

## Authors

Who have the major authors been so far? This is your chance to acknowledge your own efforts.
License

What license applies to the source code? I recommend a liberal open-source license like the MIT license or the BSD license, so that your client can have the legal right to use and extend your work later in whatever way they would like. (However, teams with an IP agreement with their client should be careful not to pick something without getting their client’s approval first.)

## Acknowledgements

Is there anybody else you’d like to thank, or any resources that have been especially helpful?
